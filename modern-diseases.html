<p class="small">We are currently living in the middle of one of the worst silent health epidemics in history, very few people talk about it, almost no men are aware of what
it means, and nationally it is almost totally ignored despite the gargantuan effects it has on our public health system and the quality of life of our people. </p>
<br>
<p class="small">What is this epidemic? A rising tide of bizarre, totally-misunderstood, consistently underdiganosed and untreated chronic illnesses. What's behind them? 
Why are they consistently correlated with one another? We don't really know... </p>
<br>
<p class="small"> OR DO WE... [dun dun dun!] </p>
<br>
<p class="small">Chronic fatigue, PCOS, endometriosis, hypothyroid disorders, IBS, fibromyalgia, POTS/OH, IC, depression, etc. etc etc. etc. - what if these diseases were NOT
random chronic ailments airdropped onto people, but were instead indicative of something deeply wrong with our healthcare/food/lifestyle?  </p>
<br>
<p class="small">I know. I am the first person to ever have this thought. All hail me. </p>
<br>
<p class="small">In all seriousness, though, this area is really just a huge focus of mine and it's something I'm going to working on for years. The quality of life reduction
caused by these diseases is immense, they adveresely affect tens of millions of people every year, and every year the diagnosis rates grow and the population affected
grows younger and younger. It also doesn't help that all of these things are huge draws for a legion of grifters, con artists, and scammers who's consistent ability to convince
people that their 'root chakra alignment crystal' will cure their 4 different chronic disorders. </p>
<br>
<p class="small">So yeah, consider this me throwing my hat in the ring on the "wtf do we do about modern disease" question </p>
<br>
<p class="small">Hypothesis #1: Endotoxin </p>
<p class="small">Endotoxin (Lipopolysaccharide) are dead, gram-negative bacterial shells that enter the bloodstream, causing systemic inflammation (bad) and a whole host
of associated health consequences. Modern diets and processed foods have probably exponentially increased the average persons exposure to endotoxin - and that's not all!
IBS, which is probably one of the most common (and most undiagnosed) chronic illnesses is heavily associated with endotoxin exposure (alongside, of course, the general 
negative health effects of poor digestion). Overall, I think the systemic inflammation induced by endotoxin probably plays a huge part in chronic illness.  </p>
<br>
<p class="small">Addressing This: </p>
<p class="small">"How do we address endotoxin" is a great question with a lot of different answers. Increasing gelatin/collagen consumption or supplementing BPC-157 to
restore the gut barrier is one large part. Consuming more fiber - especially insoluble antiseptic fibers like carrots, white mushrooms, or bamboo shoots are also good recommendations.
The use of supplements like well-aged cascara sagrada and magnesium to enhance gut motility is also likely helpful. If you're really interested in pursuing this please contact me,
lots of stuff to experiment with and I can put together a custom protocol based off you needs. </p>
<br>
<p class="small">Hypothesis #2: Kynurenine Disfunction </p>
<p class="small">For more information on this, see my article <a href="http://arakatos.com/kinurenine-pathway.html" class="sublink_small" target="_blank">on the Kynurenine Pathway Itself</a> </p>
<br>
<p class="small">Hypothesis #3: Hormonal Imbalances and Estrogen </p>
<p class="small">"Hormone imbalance" here basically means estrogen excess. Estrogen is implicated in a whole host of chronic illnesses (which is why many tend to be more 
common in women), Endometriosis for example used to be a menopausal disease. Modern exposure to endocrine disruptors and such undoubtedly has negative effects on this whole area.
Also the unique stresses of modern life probably contribute to hormone imbalances. It doesn't help that doctors are putting millions of women on synthetic estrogens the moment they
turn 13, of course, or that the 'progesterone' they prescribe to treat estrogen-induced hormonal disorders is non-bioidentical synthetic garbage, but whatever. </p>
<br>
<p class="small">Addressing This: </p>
<p class="small">Long term? Avoid endocrine disruptors, follow the endotoxin protocol above to facilitate good gut motility (less nasty hormone and bacteria buildup), 
try to avoid stress, chill the fuck out. Short term? Bioidentical progest-e works really fucking well.. </p>
<br>
<p class="small">Hypothesis #4: Hypothyroidism </p>
<p class="small">Not only is hypothyroidism a chronic disease, it is probably also one of the most common causes of it! It also definitely beats out IBS when it comes to 'underdiagnosed
disorders' in the west. Hypothyroidism is fucking killer period - if your thyroid isn't right and your metabolism is dysfunctional nothing else is going to work right either which is 
why effective treatment of chronic illness should always start with thorough analysis of the thyroid.   </p>
<br>
<p class="small">Addressing This: </p>
<p class="small">Supplementing essential nutrients (especially b vitamins), dessicated thyroid, progest-e. Maintaining a good diet. Following the endotoxin protocol above. 
Being knowledgeable about thyroid function and the important components of proper functioning thyroid. Monitoring body temperature and heart rate to ensure steady function. Eating
steady quantities of sugar, avoiding O6 PUFA, yeah. Also, key in my opinion: having a good life. A varied environment, hopeful circumstances, and an optimistic outlook are probably
all vital for this. Drowned rat studies have demonstrated that emotional state and thyroid function are well connected.  </p>
<br>
<p class="small">Hypothesis #5: All of these Combined (this is what it is) </p>
<p class="small">At the end of the day, it's definitely just all of these. Curing chronic disease is thus a matter of piling on building block after buildling block, slowly
improving each step of the bodies function as an overall system until everything is moving 'in flow' again. If you're a relative, friend, or significant other of a person with
a severe set of chronic illnesses I wish you the best of luck in convincing them of this stuff and in helping them progress in their health journey. If you have them yourself,
I'm sorry. My ex struggled with them as well and it was very painful for her. I hope you succeed and can once enjoy life as it was meant to be lived: in a biologically joyful
state. </p>
<br>
<p class="small">Whoever you are, never forget: health uber alles. Do everything you can to maintain it. We're in a very fucked-up time right now when it comes to healthcare
where the systems that dictate most of our health decisions are directed towards goals different from helping people, and a lot of people are getting left behind because of it.
It makes my blood boil which is why this is what I'm dedicated to now. Never forget the golden rule: your health is your health. Don't do anything because it's some 'protocol.' 
Try stuff on your own body and see what works, experiment, treat it like you would a treasured possession. Good luck. </p>
